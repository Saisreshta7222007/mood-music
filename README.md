Summary
-------
I extracted the embedded code from `test.html` into a separate React TypeScript component file `MoodMusicRecommender.tsx`.

What I did
- Created `MoodMusicRecommender.tsx` containing the React component and mock song data.
- Added this `README.md` and `languages.txt` to record detected languages.

Notes
- The extracted file expects a React/Next.js environment with dependencies like `react`, `lucide-react`, and local UI components under `@/components/ui/*`.
- The workspace currently doesn't include a package.json or installed dependencies; running or type-checking the TSX file will raise errors unless you set up a React project and install packages.

How to use
- Move `MoodMusicRecommender.tsx` into your Next.js or React project (for example, `app/components/MoodMusicRecommender.tsx`), ensure `react` and other dependencies are installed, and import/use the component.

If you'd like, I can:
- Create a minimal `package.json` and install dependencies.
- Place the component into a proper Next.js folder structure and add a page that renders it.
- Extract additional files (CSS/JS) if the original file contained plain HTML/CSS/JS instead of a React component.
